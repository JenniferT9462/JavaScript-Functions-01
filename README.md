# JavaScript-Functions-01
## Using JS to write a song
Each day we will learn different techniques in order to create functions that will write our song for us. 
## Day 1
Find a song that has a lot of repetition. console.log() each line. 
## Day 2
Extract the refrain into it's own function and call the function instead of writing each line out. 
## Day 3
Instead of console.log() each line for the refrain we will return the lyrics for the refrain to a string.
## Day 4
Make a webpage with a button that prints out the lyrics to your song into the HTML document.
