          You can persevere text format by using 'pre' tags. The text inside the
          tags will include the line breaks that you use and the font-weight and
          size are changed. The 'pre' tag is very helpful when displaying a poem
          or address in a webpage.

        <pre>
                I am showing you how the 'pre' tag
                works. By, writing some text inside
                the 'pre' tag. You will see that it
                has included the line breaks after
                the words: tag, inside, it and after. 
                Also, the font is different.

          console.log(`${delete_value} is deleted from the array`);
 
          console.log("updated array: ", numbers);
